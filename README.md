# Downloads

You will find a compiled program ready to use in the [releases tab](https://github.com/traso56/ThreatVisualizer/releases), extract the zip file contents somewhere and click the executable file

# How to use

You will need .NET 8 to run the program and it's windows only, I don't really do UI and didn't have the time to learn a UI framework sadly.
But well the code is there if you want to adapt it to other platforms and it may get updated eventually

[Here is a video explanation on how to use](https://youtu.be/dBdf1QqLtE0)
